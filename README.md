Unity project for my bachelor's thesis. An AR application for testing Left Atrial Appendage Occlusion procedures. This procedure consists of introducing a device inside of the Left Atrium chamber of the heart to prevent strokes in patients. The app allows the user to visualize the LA, select and introduction point for the device, then insert that device inside.
